# Backing Plates
There are two options for backing plates in the files, or you can make your own. You MUST have a backing plate installed if you're using the tens style electrodes. Leaving the prongs exposed gives a very good chance for an unexpected current path.

##Full Blanking Plate
This replaces the normal spacer found in the [Openshock Github](https://github.com/OpenShock/3DPrints/tree/master/LolasCollarSpacer) with one without holes for the prongs. This is the best choice if you plan to only use TENS pads.

## Spacer Blanking Plate 
This is meant to be used on top of the [normal spacer](https://github.com/OpenShock/3DPrints/tree/master/LolasCollarSpacer), allowing you to swap between the two options. A little more convienent when you just want to quickly throw the collar on, but you have to take more care to ensure your safety. 

# Above all, play safely
